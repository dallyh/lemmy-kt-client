# Insomnia project file
This project file can be used in [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to test the APIs. 
For this you need to have either a local instance running or a testing instance available online.

The project requires Insomnia plugin named [path parameters](https://insomnia.rest/plugins/insomnia-plugin-path-parameters) 
for some of the requests to work properly (mainly pictrs requests).

This project was created by the help of this awesome repository [lemmy_openapi_spec](https://github.com/MV-GH/lemmy_openapi_spec).
